## Features That Make Your Code Dance:

- 🩺 **Healthcheck Awesomeness:** Boilerplate code for healthchecks that's so smooth, it's practically a microservice spa day.

- 🌐 **Logger Extraordinaire:** With tracing built-in (because we like to follow the sparkly trails).

- 📊 **Database Magic:** PostgreSQL, Memcached, Redis – all wrapped up in tracing, metrics, and helper functions. It's like magic, but for databases.

- 🕹️ **Middleware Marvels:** Circuit breaker, panic prevention, ratelimit revelry, retry rollercoaster, timeout tango, validator virtuoso, and error logging excellence.

- 🛠️ **Code Generation Zen:** Init projects with a command, generate proto stubs effortlessly – because your time is better spent innovating, not initializing.
